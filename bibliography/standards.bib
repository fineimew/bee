	abstract = {This part of IEC 61000-4 defines the methods for measurement and interpretation of results for power quality parameters in a.c. power supply systems with a declared fundamental frequency of 50 Hz or 60 Hz.  Measurement methods are described for each relevant parameter in terms that give reliable and repeatable results, regardless of the method’s implementation. This standard addresses measurement methods for in-situ measurements.  Measurement of parameters covered by this standard is limited to conducted phenomena in power systems. The power quality parameters considered in this standard are power frequency, magnitude of the supply voltage, flicker, supply voltage dips and swells, voltage interruptions, transient voltages, supply voltage unbalance, voltage harmonics and interharmonics, mains signalling on the supply voltage, rapid voltage changes, and current measurements. Emissions in the 2 kHz to 150 kHz range are considered in Annex C (informative), and over- and underdeviations are considered in Annex D (informative).  Depending on the purpose of the measurement, all or a subset of the phenomena on this list may be measured.},

	title = {Analysis and design of power acceptability curves for industrial loads},
	url = {https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UuFF8CHaQDhfq7TQeldFmZNcrwmUp6Ly},
	abstract = {There  has  been  a  concern  in  recent  years  for  electric  power  utilities  to  satisfy  the  increasingly expectations of not only the industrial and commercial, but also the residential users with  respect  to  the  quality  of  the  supplied  energy.  This  concern  calls  for  the  redesigning  of  the  existing  power  quality  indices  to  capture  all  the  industrial,  commercial  and  household  loads,  which  hitherto  has  not  been  considered.  Several  electric  power  indices  have  evolved  over  the  years  as  tools  to  represent,  quantify  and  measure  a  complex  issue  at  hand.  The  use  of  these  indices is widespread in the field of electric power generation, transmission and distribution.  Another way of quantifying power quality issues is the use of power acceptability curves. These curves are plots of bus voltage deviation versus time duration. And they separate the bus voltage  deviation  -  time  duration  plane  into  two  regions:  an  "acceptable"  and  "unacceptable".  Various power acceptability curves exist but the most widely publicized one, which could stand the  test  of  time  and  could  be  relied  on,  is  the  Computer  Business  Equipment  Manufacturers  Association  or  CBEMA  curve.  The  CBEMA  curve  has  been  in  existence  since  1970’s.  Its  primarily  intent  was  to  give  a  measure  of  the  vulnerability  of  mainframe  computer  to  the  disturbance  in  the  electric  power  supply.  But  the  curve  has  been  used  as  a  measure  of  power  quality indices for electric drives and solid-state loads.  In   this   report,   the   concept   of   {\textbackslash}'standards{\textbackslash}'   is   introduced   for   the   design   of   power   acceptability  curves.  The  power  acceptability  curves  are  aides  in  the  determination  of  whether  the  supply  voltage  to  a  load  is  acceptable  for  the  maintenance  of  a  load  process.    The  construction  of  the  well  known  CBEMA  power  acceptability  curve  is  discussed,  and  issues  of  three phase and rotating loads are discussed. iiiThe  main  conclusion  of  this  work  is  that  power  acceptability  curves  can  be  designed  to  detect compliance or noncompliance of the distribution supply to effect a standard. If the load is a  rectifier  load,  the  standard  is  generally  the  permissible  low  threshold  of  DC  voltage  at  the  rectifier  output.  Other  standards  are  possible  including  a  speed  standard  for  rotating  loads.  The  general  process  of  the  design  of  a  power  acceptability  curve  entails  the  solution  of  a  dynamic  model for the load. The dynamic solution then gives a standard parameter versus time, and this is compared with the ultimate standard (e.g., Vdc = 0.87 per unit). This gives a permissible duration of a voltage sag event. The method is easily extended to the unbalanced three phase case.  It  is  shown  in  the  report  that  the  CBEMA  curve  is  effectively  based  on  a  single  phase  rectifier  load  with  DC  threshold  voltage  of  0.87  per  unit  in  the  undervoltage  region.  A  double  exponential  equation  describing  the  curve  is  developed.  This  provides  a  useful  method  to  consider  the  effect  of  unbalanced  voltage  sags  and  to  develop  CBEMA-like  curves  for  other  types of loads. A scalar index of compliance with a power acceptability curve has been illustrated in this report as well.},

The transfer file format includes the power quality measurements as well as appropriate characterization parameters, such as sampling rate, resolution, calibration status, instrument identification, location, and other related data or characteristics. The recommended practice also provides guidelines for transferring power quality data. Although it was reaffirmed in 2008, the field of power quality monitoring has evolved in the past decade, and the changes in this domain are not reflected in the current version of 1159.3. The paper will present the changes planned for the revision that will take place in 2015 and 2016.},

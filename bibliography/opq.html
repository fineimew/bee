<blockquote><font size="-1">
As power grids transition from a centralized distribution model to a distributed model, maintaining grid stability requires real-time power quality (PQ) monitoring and visualization. As part of the Open Power Quality (OPQ) project, we designed and deployed a set of open source power quality monitors and an open source cloud-based aggregation and visualization system built with the utility customer in mind. Our aim is to leverage a flexible privacy model combined with inexpensive and easy to use PQ meters in order to deploy a high density power quality monitoring network across the Hawaiian islands. In this paper we describe OPHub, a privacy focused open source PQ visualization along with results of a small scale deployment of our prototype PQ meter across the island of Oahu. Our results demonstrate that OPQ can provide useful power quality data at an order of magnitude less cost than prior approaches.

 OPQ Version 2: An Architecture for Distributed,

<blockquote><font size="-1">
OpenPowerQuality (OPQ) is a framework that supports end-to-end capture, analysis, and visualizations of distributed real-time power quality (PQ) data. Version 2 of OPQ builds on version 1 by providing higher sampling rates, optional battery backup, end-to-end security, GPS synchronization, pluggable analysis, and a real-time visualization framework. OPQ provides real-time distributed power measurements which allows users to see both local PQ events and grid-wide PQ events. The OPQ project has three principal components: back-end hardware for making power measurements, middleware for data acquisition and analysis, and a front-end providing visualizations. OPQBox2 is a hardware platform that takes PQ measurements, provides onboard analysis, and securely transfers data to our middleware. The OPQ middleware performs filtering on the OPQBox2 sensor data and performs high-level PQ analysis. The results of our PQ analysis and real-time state of the sensor network are displayed using OPQView. We’ve collected distributed PQ datafrom locations across Oahu, Hawaii and have demonstrated our ability to detect both local and grid-wide power quality events.

 Compression and compressed sensing in bandwidth constrained sensor
  networks.
 Technical Report CSDL-17-02, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI,

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Improvements in sensor and radio technologies allow for creation of cheap sensors interconnected via radio links and the Internet. These advancements opened the door for creation of large area autonomous monitoring networks referred to as sensor networks. Bandwidth requirements of a wireless sensor network has a direct effect on its performance. This paper describes three bandwidth reduction methods: lossless compression, lossy compression, and compressed sensing.

 Data management for distributed sensor networks: A literature
  review.
 Technical Report CSDL-17-01, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI,

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Sensor networks are spatially distributed autonomous sensors that monitor the physical world around them and often communicate those reading over a network to a server or servers. Sensor networks can benefit from the generally “unlimited resources” of the cloud, namely processing, storage, and network resources. This literature review surveys the major components of distributed data management, namely, cloud computing, distributed persistence models, and distributed analytics.

 Design, Implementation, and Initial Evaluation of OPQBox: A
  low-cost device for crowdsourced power quality monitoring.
 Technical Report CSDL-14-11, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI,

<blockquote><font size="-1">
The face of power distribution has changed rapidly over the last several decades. Modern grids are evolving to accommodate distributed power generation, and highly variable loads. Furthermore as the devices we use every day become more electronically complex, they become increasingly more sensitive to power quality problems. Distributed power quality monitoring systems have been shown to provide real-time insight on the status of the power grid and even pinpoint the origin of power disturbances. [6] Oahu’s isolated power grid combined with high penetration of distributed renewable energy generators create perfect conditions to assess the feasibility and utility of such a network. Over the last three months we have been collecting power quality data from several locations on Oahu as a pilot study for a larger monitoring system. This papers describes our methodology, hardware and software design and presents a preliminary analysis of the data we collected so far. Lastly this paper presents a design for an improved power quality monitor based upon the pilot study experiences.

 OPQ Cloud: A scalable software framework for the aggregation of
  distributed power quality data.
 Technical Report CSDL-14-04, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI,

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Power quality issues can be caused in a variety of situations. Voltage fluctuations, frequency fluctuations, and harmonics are all power quality issues which can be caused by weather, high penetration of renewables, man-made issues, or other natural phenomena. We designed a software framework which can aggregate crowdsourced distributed power quality measurements in order to study power quality issues over a dense geographic area.

 Enabling active participation in the Smart Grid through
  crowdsourced power quality data.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
This technical report presents a research project designed to gain insight into the following questions: Can crowdsourced power quality data enable active participation in the Smart Grid? What are the technical, social, behavioral, and economic requirements for crowdsourced data that make it effective for detection, monitoring, prediction and diagnosis of selected Smart Grid power quality issues? And finally, how can these project outcomes improve “citizen science” in general and the kinds of intrinsic and extrinsic motivators needed for successful outcomes?

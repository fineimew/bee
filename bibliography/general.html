<blockquote><font size="-1">
This book is organized into 11 chapters.
Chapter 1 deals with general terminology used in power quality, reliability, and the ITI (CBEMA) curve.
Chapter 2 discusses SVCs used in main transmission systems, as well as those used to correct unbalances due to traction loads. 
Chapter 3 deals with the control of the SVCs both for main transmission systems and those used to compensate unsymmetric traction single-phase loads.
Chapter 4 considers harmonics and their sources.
Chapter 5 describes the utility harmonic regulations and standards. 
Chapter 6 focuses on the undesirable effects of harmonics and mitigation techniques. 
Chapter 7 presents the computation tools that are available for the design and analysis of SVCs and harmonic filters. 
Chapter 8 is devoted to the different aspects of monitoring power quality. 
Chapter 9 presents the constructional details of HV reactors and the considerations involved in the choice of their location at the end of EHV lines, tertiary windings of transformers, etc. 
Chapter 10 describes the use of shunt capacitors for reactive compensation and power factor correction. 
Chapter 11 presents fast Fourier transforms (FFT).

Mark Stephens.
 Power Factor Correction and Harmonics, 2007.
<blockquote><font size="-1">
Two parts.  First part explains what power factor is, how harmonics impact on power factor, and how to correct power factor. Second part explains what harmonics are, what causes them (switch mode power supplies, adjustable speed drives, DC drives, and electronic ballasts); impacts of harmonics (not much on heating, most impact on data processing/communications equipment), and how to deal with them (filtering).

How to protect against problems due to voltage sags by appropriate design.  Approaches: Use DC power instead of AC, Utilize sag-tolerant components that satisfy SEMI F47, apply custom programming techniques such as delay filters, state machine programming, phase voltage sensing relay, specify configuration settings appropriately, use appropriate trip curves for circuit breakers.

 Effects of Voltage Sags on Industrial Equipment, 2007.
[&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sceg.com/docs/librariesprovider5/pdfs/effectofvoltagesagsonindustrial_equipment.pdf">.pdf</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote><font size="-1">
Presents examples of using "Porto-Sag" to assess the impact of voltage sags on equipment.  Voltage sags are "the most important pq variation affecting sensitive equipment".  Voltage sags are defined in terms of magnitude (i.e. 50% of nominal) and duration (i.e. 4 cycles). Results on various computers (Dell, HP netserver, Compaq) show actual values for voltage sags that induce equipment failure.  Also looked at PLCs, relays, adjustable speed drives.

 No Harmony in Harmonics.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Harmonic currents generated by non-linear electronic loads increase power system heat losses and power bills for end users. These harmonic-related losses reduce system efficiency, cause apparatus overheating, and increase power and air conditioning costs. As the number of harmonics-producing loads has increased over the years, it has become increasingly necessary to address their influence when making any additions or changes to an installation.  Harmonic currents can have a significant impact on electrical distribution systems and the facilities they feed. It is important to consider their impact when planning additions or changes to a system. In addition, identifying the size and location of non-linear loads should be an important part of any maintenance, troubleshooting and repair program.

LED driver response to short-duration RMS voltage variations. This article is Part 2 of a new seven-part series on the effects of power quality disturbances on a five-stage electronic LED driver. In Part 1, which ran in the April 2018 issue, we listed seven categories of electrical disturbances as defined in Table 2 per IEEE 1159-2009, Recommended Practice for Monitoring Electric Power Quality. Our discussion focused on long-duration RMS variations. We now turn our attention to short-duration RMS variations.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Which power quality interruptions are most likely to disturb your LED lighting system? This article starts a seven-part series on the effects of power quality disturbances on a five-stage electronic LED driver. As electrical designers, we know each circuit has a characteristic frequency response, meaning that signals of some frequency can get through a circuit, and others cannot. The same is true when you talk about the effects of power quality (PQ) disturbances on electronic ballasts. Each disturbance category has its own frequency characteristics as well.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
This paper presents the two main types of classification methods for power quality disturbances based on underlying causes: deterministic classification, giving an expert system as an example, and statistical classification, with support vector machines (a novel method) as an example. An expert system is suitable when one has limited amount of data and sufficient power system expert knowledge; however, its application requires a set of threshold values. Statistical methods are suitable when large amount of data is available for training. Two important issues to guarantee the effectiveness of a classifier, data segmentation, and feature extraction are discussed. Segmentation of a sequence of data recording is preprocessing to partition the data into segments each representing a duration containing either an event or a transition between two events. Extraction of features is applied to each segment individually. Some useful features and their effectiveness are then discussed. Some experimental results are included for demonstrating the effectiveness of both systems. Finally, conclusions are given together with the discussion of some future research directions.

 <em>Calculating voltage dips in power systems using probability
  distributions of dip durations and implementation of the Moving Fault
  Node method</em>.

This report is based on a master thesis work aimed at improving the Simpow Dips program, by
implementing new features. Simpow Dips, in its existing version, simulates faults in all nodes
in a given network and creates a result-file containing the during-fault voltages at each node
for every fault. Improvements have been made in three aspects: the ability to also calculate
the dip duration, an improved method for calculating the magnitude of the dip and a graphical
presentation of the calculation results.

 Classification of power system disturbances using support vector
  machines.
 <em>Expert Systems with Applications</em>, 36, August 2009.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
This paper presents an effective method based on support vector machines (SVM) for identification of power system disturbances. Because of its advantages in signal processing applications, the wavelet transform (WT) is used to extract the distinctive features of the voltage signals. After the wavelet decomposition, the characteristic features of each disturbance waveforms are obtained. The wavelet energy criterion is also applied to wavelet detail coefficients to reduce the sizes of data set. After feature extraction stage SVM is used to classify the power system disturbance waveforms and the performance of SVM is compared with the artificial neural networks (ANN).

 Wavelet and PCA to Power Quality Disturbance Classification
  Applying a RBF Network.
 In <em>Power Quality: Monitoring, Analysis, and
  Enhancement</em>. InTechOpen, October 2010.
[&nbsp;<a href="https://www.intechopen.com/books/power-quality-monitoring-analysis-and-enhancement/wavelet-and-pca-to-power-quality-disturbance-classification-applying-a-rbf-network">http</a>&nbsp;]
<blockquote><font size="-1">
This chapter proposes the application of a different method of power quality disturbance classification by combining discrete wavelet transform (DWT), principal component analysis (PCA) and an artificial neural network in order to classify power quality disturbances. The method proposes to analyze seven classes of signals, namely Sinusoidal Waveform, Capacitor Switching Transient, Flicker, Harmonics, Interruption, Notching and Sag, which is composed by four main stages: (1) signal analysis using the DWT; (2) feature extraction; (3) data reduction using PCA; (4) classification using a radial basis function network (RBF). The MRA technique of DWT is employed to extract the discriminating features of distorted signals at different resolution levels. Subsequently, the PCA is used to condense information of a correlated set of variables into a few variables, and a RBF network is employed to classify the disturbance types.

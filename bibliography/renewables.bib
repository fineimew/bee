	abstract = {Recently, growing electrical energy market and increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RES) in power systems have lead to new challenges on network planning step and operation, thus it is required to investigate and analyze properly the impacts of integrated RES on the power system. In this paper, the electricity transmission network with wind farms (WF) is modeled. For the grid model, a part of Izmir region is chosen due to the amount of installed generation plants based RES especially wind energy in this region. The comparison between unexpected variations to voltage profile of the power system before and after RES integration to the power system is demonstrated. In the modeling of the electricity transmission network with RES, Digsilent/Power Factory is used as software. The different case studies in integration of different amounts of RES are implemented on the developed grid model. As a result of the conducted case studies, effects of RES on existing power system are evaluated and graphics obtained from the simulation are presented. Especially, the voltage profile of power system is examined.},

	url = {http://vuir.vu.edu.au/17910/},
	abstract = {The impact of renewable energy installations connected to the utility grid is an important issue concerning the technical and economic viability of harnessing these emerging energy sources. Distribution networks must be carefully controlled in order to maintain an acceptable power supply quality. The major sources of non-conventional energy are small scale generation and storage from mini hydro, photovoltaic, wind power, fuel cells, battery, flywheel, pump storage and biomass. The aim of this thesis is to analyse the variation in voltage of the distribution network when renewable energy sources are interconnected to the distribution network, in terms of it's stability. In particular this study analyses the impact of interconnection of small synchronous generators to the utility power grid. Dynamic stability analysis is mainly concerned with analysing the response of electrical power system to small perturbation about a given operating point. These studies are particularly important due to the growing interest in interconnecting small renewable energy sources to large and complex power systems. Simulation studies were carried out in order to find out the transient stability and voltage stability of the non-conventional energy sources under different operating conditions. A 5-second simulation was conducted using explicit numerical integration (Euler method) and an integration time step of 0.002 second. Power System Toolbox was used for analysis.The multimachine power system models used in this thesis are generated in MATLAB code. The load flow is performed on the multimachine power system correponding to the loading condition to be investigated. The machines are represented by the two-axis models, the exciters by IEEE Type-1 models and the loads are modelled as constant impedances. To save programming time, it has become common to limit the machine and exciter representations to some specified models. The network admittance matrix is reduced by retaining only the internal buses of the generators. The reduced network, machine and exciter data are then combined to form a linearised state-space model representing the entire system. The simulation studies are applied to a four machine ten bus system. It is clear from the analysis that much care should be taken based on the stability point of view while interconnecting the small renewable energy sources to the utility. The renewable energy sources should be interconnected at a point which provides higher stability margin.The renewable energy sources is a viable option if it is connected to the distribution network with necessary methods of improving transient stability and voltage stability.},

	abstract = {abstract: There has been a considerable growth in distributed photovoltaic (PV) genera-tion and its integration in electric power distribution systems. This has led to a change in the distribution system infrastructure. Properly planned distributed gen-eration can offer a variety of benefits for system operations and enhance opera-tional performance of the distribution system. However, high penetration of PV resources can give rise to operating conditions which do not arise in traditional systems and one of the potential issues that needs to be addressed involves impact on power quality of the system with respect to the spectral distortion in voltages and currents. The test bed feeder model representing a real operational distribution feeder is developed in OpenDSS and the feeder modeling takes into consideration the ob-jective of analysis and frequency of interest. Extensive metering infrastructure and measurements are utilized for validation of the model at harmonic frequencies. The harmonic study performed is divided into two sections: study of impact of non-linear loads on total harmonic voltage and current distortions and study of impact of PV resources on high frequency spectral distortion in voltages and cur-rents. The research work incorporates different harmonic study methodologies such as harmonic and high frequency power flow, and frequency scan study. The general conclusions are presented based on the simulation results and in addition, scope for future work is discussed. Dissertation/Thesis Masters Thesis Electrical Engineering 2014},

	abstract = {The generation of electricity through renewable sources has exponentially increased in recent years in response to environmental pollution caused by fossil fuels. When we talk about renewable energy is difficult not to refer to solar photovoltaic technology due to its high rate of growth compared to their peers and potential. This is associated with the fact that the Ecuadorian government is implementing a process of changing the production and country's energy matrix where one of the fundamental pillars is to eliminate dependence on fossil resources and promote the use of renewable energy. Therefore, this makes clear that it is important and needed to study the effects and possible problems that entails the use of photovoltaic systems connected to the network. In this context, this work focuses on power quality by connecting photovoltaic plants to low-power electrical distribution networks. The evaluated system is composed of a group of panels of different technologies connected to a communication unit that forms the connection point of the photovoltaic system and the electric network. Measurement and data acquisition in real time of the implemented system and the respective analysis was made by considering the existing regulations. Finally, a mathematical analysis was performed in order to analyze the impact of the most important variables on power quality.},

	abstract = {The abundance, availability, and climate-friendly characteristics of solar photovoltaic (PV) energy encourage nations around the globe to adopt it to assist in overcoming global warming as well as build a sustainable society for the future. The intermittent nature of solar energy generation and the associated power electronic inverters with connected consumer loads creates a number of potential challenges in integrating large-scale PV into the grid that affects power quality of the distribution networks. This paper investigates the impacts of varying PV integration into the grid through experimental and simulation studies. Initially, several experiments were conducted with varying PV penetration and load conditions using the Renewable Energy Integration Facility at CSIRO, Newcastle, Australia. Later, a simulation model was developed that mimics the experimental facility used at CSIRO to investigate the adverse impacts on integrating large-scale PV into the grid using the power system simulation software PSS Sincal. Experimental and simulation analyses clearly indicate that integration of PV into the grid causes power quality issues such as voltage instability, harmonic injection, and low power factor into the networks and the level of these impacts increases with the increase of PV penetration.},

This paper aims to assess the impact of photovoltaic distributed generation (PVDG) connection on the power quality indices (PQI) of distribution networks, such as: long term voltage variations (voltage conformity issues) and voltage unbalance. The stochastic nature of PVDG and loads were considered in the study using probabilistic techniques. The impact of PVDG on the number of tap changes of the voltage regulators was investigated. The tests results in a real life large scale distribution network demonstrated that the PVDG can cause around 31\% of improvements in the voltage conformity indices. This impact is less beneficial than the one associated with the connection of conventional distributed generation due to the variability in the primary energy resource. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the connection of PVDG increases the lifespan of the voltage regulators as a result of a reduction about 20\% in the number of tap changes.},

	abstract = {Electricity generation from solar energy by using PV cells is drastically increased due to global warming concern, greenhouse effect, and quality of living standards. However, PV generation may offer variable and unpredictable energy output due to intermittent nature of solar irradiance and hence, integration of PV into grid may provide some drawback effect to the power system. The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of grid connected PV system on the power quality of distribution network. The power quality analysis is based on real measurements of 10 kWp, Energy Park SERT, School of Renewable Energy, Naresuan University, Thailand. Parameters such as active and reactive power, voltage, current, power factor, THDv, THDi, individual harmonic voltage and harmonic current are observed for the investigation of the interaction between SERT PV system and distribution network’s power quality. According to the measured data, PV system operation is negligible in terms of voltage distortion, voltage magnitude and frequency variation. Therefore, it can be noticed that 10 kWp SERT PV system does not effect on the distribution system power quality due to low PV penetration level.},

The focus is on the production of electric energy by photovoltaic systems in public distribution networks. Photovoltaic systems may in certain cases influence voltage quality in public distribution networks, which is determined by the EN 50160 standard. Photovoltaic systems affect the voltage profile and harmonic distortion of current and voltage. Ensuring the appropriate voltage profile is especially important in radial networks because of eventual huge voltage drops. Many photovoltaic systems on a radial network with relatively high short-circuit impedance and relatively low short-circuit power can be problematic with regard to the permitted level of harmonic distortion, particularly at lower power.

Recently, grid connected PV micro-generation facilities in individual homes have increased due to governmental policies as well as greater attention by industry. As low voltage (LV) distribution systems were built to make energy flow in one direction, the power feed-in of PV generation in rural low-voltage grids can influence power quality (PQ) as well as facility operation and reliability. This paper presents results on PQ analysis of a real PV generation facility connected to a rural low-voltage grid. Voltage fluctuations and voltage harmonic contents were observed. Statistical analysis shows a negative impact on PQ produced by this PV facility and also that only a small fraction of the energy available during a sunny day is converted, provoking losses of revenue and forcing the converter to work in an undesirable operating mode. We discuss the disturbances imposed upon the grid and their outcome regarding technical and economic viability of the PV system, as well as possible solutions. A low-voltage grid strengthening has been suggested and implemented. After that a new PQ analysis shows an improvement in the impact upon PQ, making this facility economically viable.},

	abstract = {The rapid increase of the grid-connected solar photovoltaic (PV) has been reported to make a considerable impact on the power quality (PQ) in the grid. This paper discusses the generation and propagation of significant current/voltage harmonics which are caused by PV inverters in distribution networks. The impact made by high switching frequencies and different operating scenarios are studied by detailed modelling of PV inverters in a typical low voltage (LV) distribution network using PSCAD/EMTDC simulation platform. It was found that the PV inverter systems inject high frequency current harmonics at the switching frequency or associated side bands. Low order current harmonics are also significant due to the inability of switching control system of PV inverter to produce perfectly sinusoidal output. It is found that the amount of harmonics depend on the inverter control strategy, background distortion present at the point of connection (POC) and the percentage of inverter loading. Further, harmonic voltage distortion is found to be mainly dependent on the impedance of the distribution network where weak networks lead to give rise to higher voltage distortions. Moreover, harmonic resonances are significant due to the interaction of the inverter output impedance and the grid inductance. The current harmonics injected by single phase inverters have been found substantial and influential with regard to the energy transmission and increase losses.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of variable electricity generation in low-voltage electricity grids poses new challenges to the operation of power systems. Distributed non-dispatchable electricity from renewable sources, such as photovoltaic solar energy, can potentially impact power quality, particularly voltage regulation. In response, inverter manufacturers and recent standards have introduced automatic inverter response functions, such as the commonly known as Volt-Watt and Volt-VAR functions. These functions aim to mitigate under- and over-voltage events by gracefully curtailing injected active power, or injecting/absorbing reactive power when the voltage at the point of coupling exceeds the predefined regulation limits. While the utility of these new inverter functionalities has been established in various studies, the analysis of their stability properties, particularly in the context of persistent changes in load, remains scarce. This paper contributes a framework for nonlinear analysis of voltage stability and boundedness in distribution networks with variable loads. The framework is applied to the case of a single grid-connected inverter to derive sufficient conditions for steady-state voltage boundedness as a function of the load variation levels in the inverter bus. Simulation results illustrate the accuracy of these bounds for varying load conditions.},

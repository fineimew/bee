	abstract = {The draft grid modernization plan which HECO released late last week can be seen in light of these contradictions, as well as the requirement by state regulators that such grid modernization be done cost-effectively. After the state’s Public Utilities Commission rejected a 340 million grid modernization plan six months ago, HECO has come back with a plan whose first phase involves outlays of 205 million through 2023.},

Achieving the renewable portfolio standard goals will require a combination of both customer-owned distributed resources as well as larger grid-scale resources},

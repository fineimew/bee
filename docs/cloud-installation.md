title: OPQ Cloud Installation
sidebar_label: Installation
---

OPQ Cloud currently consists of six services: OPQ Makai (for triggering and collecting power quality data from boxes), OPQ Mauka (for analysis and classification of power quality data), OPQ View (for data visualization and system management), OPQ Health (for monitoring boxes and services), OPQ Box Updater (for over-the-air updates to the Box software), and MongoDB (the backend database system).

We utilize [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to manage the installation of each of these OPQ Cloud services.

We publish official Docker images for all of these services to the [Open Power Quality organization at DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/openpowerquality).  

Note: OPQ Cloud can currently be installed only on Unix (Macintosh and Linux) systems.

## Initial installation

### Install Docker and Docker Compose

The first step in installing OPQ Cloud is to install Docker and Docker Compose on your production system.

Please consult the [Docker installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and the [Docker Compose installation documentation](
https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for instructions.

### Download opq-docker repo

Next, download the [OPQ Docker GitHub repository](https://github.com/openpowerquality/opq-docker). 

You can either download it as a zip file and uncompress it to create a local directory named "opq-docker-master", or clone it from GitHub with `git clone https://github.com/openpowerquality/opq-docker.git` - which will create a local directory named "opq-docker".

The advantage to the latter approach is that if we make updates to the files, you can get the changes easily by pulling them from GitHub. Otherwise, you have to download a new zip file and migrate your changes into it.

### Edit config files

Your local opq-docker directory contains a subdirectory called "sample-config" containing a set of configuration files for each of the services.

These sample configuration files provide the recommended default values for most configuration variables that are appropriate for normal installations.  As the directory name implies, the "sample-config" files are just a set of recommended default configuration files.

#### Create config dir

In order for OPQ Cloud to deploy successfully, it expects to find these files in a directory named "config" - which you will need to create yourself for your OPQ Cloud installation.

Change into the top-level directory and copy all the default configuration files by invoking:

```shell
mkdir config
cp -R sample-config/* config
```

#### Edit view.config.json file

While we recommend initially using the default values provided by our sample configuration files, there is one configuration file that you **must** modify in order to create an initial OPQ Cloud user: `view.config.json`.

Change into the `config/view` directory and edit the `view.config.json` file.

Look for a section called "userProfiles", which has one entry with all blank fields. You will want to fill out the "username" field with an email address of an admin at your site (for example, "johnson@hawaii.edu"), provide a password (for example, "6ydhdk3ac!"), a first name (for example, "Philip"), last name (for example, "Johnson"), and role (which should be "admin").

### Bring up services

Now, cd into the top-level directory, where you should find a script called `docker-compose-run.sh`.  To make it executable, invoke:

```shell
chmod 775 docker-compose-run.sh
```

Invoke it with:

```shell
./docker-compose-run.sh
```

This will download all the latest official public images for each of the OPQ Cloud services, and run them.  The output should look like this:

```shell
$ ./docker-compose-run.sh

### Verify installation

Invoke the `docker ps` command to verify that all OPQ Cloud containers are running. It should look similar to this:

```shell
$ docker ps

```

In addition, you should also check the OPQ View service by opening up your web browser and going to http://localhost:8888.
You should see the landing page of OPQ View, and the System Health panel should show that all services have been contacted and appear to be functional:

<img src="/docs/assets/cloud/view-landing.png" width="100%">

(Note: this image should be replaced with one that more accurately reflects what a "fresh" OPQ Cloud instance should look like.)

### Define users, boxes, locations

To complete your installation, you will want to define additional OPQ View users, as well as OPQ Boxes and Locations. To do this, you can login to your OPQ View service with your admin username and password, and then use its interface to complete your installation.

See the [OPQ View documentation](cloud-view.html) for details on this step.


### HTTPS Setup

Although the OPQ View application is available over HTTP on port 8888, with a few simple steps, you can easily request
SSL certificates for your domain (from Let's Encrypt) and have your application running over HTTPS instead.

As part of your OPQ Cloud installation, we include the `nginx` and `certbot` services to handle the legwork of setting
up HTTPS. More specifically, an Nginx web server on port 80 is automatically configured to forward HTTP traffic to an
HTTPS web server on port 443, which subsequently reverse proxies traffic to the OPQ View application on port 8888.

As such, please make sure that your host machine has port 80 and 443 open to the outside world. It is also recommended
that you setup a firewall on port 8888 once you have HTTPS up and running - otherwise the View application will still
be accessible over HTTP on port 8888.

#### Modify the nginx.env configuration file

To begin, you will need to modify some of the configuration variables in the `opq-docker/config/nginx/nginx.env` file.
This configuration file should have already been copied over from the `sample-config` directory earlier during the OPQ
Cloud setup process.

This file contains a few variables that you will need to modify. It looks like this:

```shell
NGINX_SERVER_NAME=example.org
LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=user@example.org
LETSENCRYPT_STAGING_MODE=1
```

Modify the `NGINX_SERVER_NAME` variable with the domain name pointing to your host machine.

Then, modify the `LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL` variable with an email address that should be associated with the SSL certificate
generated for the given domain name.

Leave the `LETSENCRYPT_STAGING_MODE` variable set to `1` for the time being. This will ensure that you do not hit any
certificate request limit while testing your HTTPS configuration.

Your `nginx.env` file should now look something like this:

```shell
NGINX_SERVER_NAME=emilia.ics.hawaii.edu
LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=admin@openpowerquality.org
LETSENCRYPT_STAGING_MODE=1
```

#### Perform a test run with LETSENCRYPT_STAGING_MODE = 1

Before we begin, ensure that all OPQ Cloud services are shut down by changing into the `opq-docker` directory and
invoking `docker-compose down`.

Then, invoke the `init-letsencrypt.sh` script and follow the prompts. It should look something like this:

```shell
opquser@emilia:~/opq-docker$ ./init-letsencrypt.sh
Existing data found for emilia.ics.hawaii.edu. Continue and replace existing certificate? (y/N) y

Now, verify that the (fake) SSL certificate was properly generated by opening up your web browser and
visiting your View application at the domain name that you specified. Each web browser application should have a way
to display the SSL certificates of the web site being visited. On Chrome, it should look similar to this:

<img src="/docs/assets/cloud/https-setup-1.png">


#### Request real SSL certificate with LETSENCRYPT_STAGING_MODE = 0

Now that everything looks good, we can now go ahead and request a real SSL certificate!

First, shut down all OPQ Cloud services by changing into the `opq-docker` directory and invoking `docker-compose down`.

Then, open the `opq-docker/config/nginx/nginx.env` file and set the `LETSENCRYPT_STAGING_MODE` variable to `0`.
The file should now look something like this:

```shell
NGINX_SERVER_NAME=emilia.ics.hawaii.edu
LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=admin@openpowerquality.org
LETSENCRYPT_STAGING_MODE=0
```

Finally, invoke the `init-letsencrypt.sh` script and follow the prompts. The output should be nearly identical to
that of the test run that was performed earlier:

```shell

## Managing the installation

### Bring all services down

If you need to bring all services down for any reason, just change into the top-level directory (where the `docker-compose.yml` file is), and invoke `docker-compose down`:

```shell
$ docker-compose down
Stopping opq-docker_health_1          ... done
Stopping opq-docker_view_1            ... done
Stopping opq-docker_mauka_1           ... done
Stopping opq-docker_makai_1           ... done
Stopping opq-docker_boxupdateserver_1 ... done
Stopping opq-docker_mongo_1           ... done
Removing opq-docker_health_1          ... done
Removing opq-docker_view_1            ... done
Removing opq-docker_mauka_1           ... done
Removing opq-docker_makai_1           ... done
Removing opq-docker_boxupdateserver_1 ... done
Removing opq-docker_mongo_1           ... done
Removing network opq-docker_default
```
### Bring all services up

To bring all services up, just invoke the `docker-compose-run.sh` script:

```shell
$ ./docker-compose-run.sh
Creating network "opq-docker_default" with the default driver
Creating opq-docker_mongo_1           ... done
Creating opq-docker_boxupdateserver_1 ... done
Creating opq-docker_view_1            ... done
Creating opq-docker_makai_1           ... done
Creating opq-docker_mauka_1           ... done
Creating opq-docker_health_1          ... done
```

### Update a single service

We will occasionally make new releases of OPQ Cloud services.

If you installed OPQ Cloud by git cloning the official [OPQ Docker GitHub repository](https://github.com/openpowerquality/opq-docker), updating is a trivial process:

On your production system, change into the `opq-docker` directory and pull the latest files by invoking:

```shell
git pull origin master
```

Then, redeploy OPQ Cloud with the latest changes by invoking the `docker-compose-run.sh` script:

```shell
./docker-compose-run.sh
```

Note that we did not have to shut down the currently running OPQ Cloud instance - in most cases, it should not be necessary at all.

When invoking the `docker-compose-run.sh` script, Docker Compose detects the differences between the previous and new OPQ Cloud configuration files and only redeploys the necessary services.
For example, after pulling the latest changes from the official OPQ Docker GitHub repository - in which the only change was a new version of the official OPQ View image, the resulting re-deployment output looks like:

```shell
$ ./docker-compose-run.sh
opq-docker_mongo_1 is up-to-date
opq-docker_boxupdateserver_1 is up-to-date
opq-docker_makai_1 is up-to-date
Recreating opq-docker_view_1 ... done
opq-docker_mauka_1 is up-to-date
opq-docker_health_1 is up-to-date
```

### Prune containers and images

As noted in the [Docker chapter on prune unused Docker objects](https://docs.docker.com/config/pruning/), when you install new Docker images, the old ones are not automatically deleted. Over time, unused and out of date Docker objects can consume significant amounts of disk space.  

To determine if you have unused Docker containers, you can run the `docker ps -a` command, which lists both running and stopped containers. Here is a sample run of that command:

```shell
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                      COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                                                                                                                                       NAMES

In this sample output, all containers are current and running. Should you discover stopped and out-of-date containers, you can run the following commands to get rid of both out of date containers and images.

To prune containers:

```shell
$ docker container prune
WARNING! This will remove all stopped containers.
Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
Total reclaimed space: 0B
```

To prune images:

```shell
$ docker image prune -a
  WARNING! This will remove all images without at least one container associated to them.
  Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y

### List container names
 
 `docker_names` is a script (defined in [system-utils.sh](https://github.com/openpowerquality/opq/blob/master/util/system/system-utils.sh)) that lists the (long) names of all active containers:
 
 ```
 $ docker_names
 opq-docker_health_1
 opq-docker_certbot_1
 opq-docker_nginx_1
 opq-docker_view_1
 opq-docker_mauka_1
 opq-docker_makai_1
 opq-mongo
 opq-docker_boxupdateserver_1
``` 

### Print container log
 
 Use docker_log with a "short service name" (i.e. health, certbot, nginx, view, mauka, makai, mongo, boxupdateserver) to get its logs:

```
$ docker_log view
Starting cron job to update health status every 10 seconds.
Starting Hourly Notification Cron to check for undelivered notifications every hour
Starting Daily Notification Cron to check for notifications every day at 6AM.
Starting Hourly Notification Cron to find notifications older than 48 hours
Starting cron job to update system stats every 59 seconds.
``` 

### Grep container log 

User docker_grep with a short service name (see above) to print the log with the grep string highlighted:

```markdown
$ docker_grep view "Daily"
Starting cron job to update health status every 10 seconds.
Starting Hourly Notification Cron to check for undelivered notifications every hour
Starting **Daily** Notification Cron to check for notifications every day at 6AM.
Starting Hourly Notification Cron to find notifications older than 48 hours
Starting cron job to update system stats every 59 seconds.

```

We are super, duper psyched to announce that a **third** design for our second generation OPQBox hardware device is now available for review at the OPQBox2 Repo Home Page.

We are making engineering samples of this design, although we are also continuing to make design changes and improvements.  

Please take a look and let us know what you think.

The OPQ Team is pleased to announce its collaboration with EPRI (Electric Power Research Institute).  For the past six months, EPRI has been evaluating OPQ technology to assess its ability to support the evaluation of advanced power quality analytics under development by EPRI.  Bill Howe, Program Manager for Power Quality at EPRI, said, "The Open Power Quality project has produced novel hardware and software technology for power quality collection and analysis, and made it available to the community as open source. We are excited to evaluate its potential to help us address important power quality problems in industry."

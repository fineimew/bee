OPQ finally has t-shirts thanks to the design efforts of [Camelia Lai](https://camelial.github.io/)!  From left, Charles Dickens, Kaila Foltz, Anthony Christe, and Philip Johnson doing a group selfie at the 2018 Fall Vertically Integrated Projects demonstration. 

The back of the shirt (not pictured) says, "Power Quality To The People!".

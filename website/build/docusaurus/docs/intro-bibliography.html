OpenPowerQuality: An Open Source Framework for Power
Quality Collection, Analysis, Visualization, and Privacy.
In <em>Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Innovative
Smart Grid Technologies (ISGT2016)</em>, Minneapolis, MN, USA, 2016.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
As power grids transition from a centralized distribution model to a distributed model, maintaining grid stability requires real-time power quality (PQ) monitoring and visualization. As part of the Open Power Quality (OPQ) project, we designed and deployed a set of open source power quality monitors and an open source cloud-based aggregation and visualization system built with the utility customer in mind. Our aim is to leverage a flexible privacy model combined with inexpensive and easy to use PQ meters in order to deploy a high density power quality monitoring network across the Hawaiian islands. In this paper we describe OPHub, a privacy focused open source PQ visualization along with results of a small scale deployment of our prototype PQ meter across the island of Oahu. Our results demonstrate that OPQ can provide useful power quality data at an order of magnitude less cost than prior approaches.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
OpenPowerQuality (OPQ) is a framework that supports end-to-end capture, analysis, and visualizations of distributed real-time power quality (PQ) data. Version 2 of OPQ builds on version 1 by providing higher sampling rates, optional battery backup, end-to-end security, GPS synchronization, pluggable analysis, and a real-time visualization framework. OPQ provides real-time distributed power measurements which allows users to see both local PQ events and grid-wide PQ events. The OPQ project has three principal components: back-end hardware for making power measurements, middleware for data acquisition and analysis, and a front-end providing visualizations. OPQBox2 is a hardware platform that takes PQ measurements, provides onboard analysis, and securely transfers data to our middleware. The OPQ middleware performs filtering on the OPQBox2 sensor data and performs high-level PQ analysis. The results of our PQ analysis and real-time state of the sensor network are displayed using OPQView. We’ve collected distributed PQ datafrom locations across Oahu, Hawaii and have demonstrated our ability to detect both local and grid-wide power quality events.

Improvements in sensor and radio technologies allow for creation of cheap sensors interconnected via radio links and the Internet. These advancements opened the door for creation of large area autonomous monitoring networks referred to as sensor networks. Bandwidth requirements of a wireless sensor network has a direct effect on its performance. This paper describes three bandwidth reduction methods: lossless compression, lossy compression, and compressed sensing.

Sensor networks are spatially distributed autonomous sensors that monitor the physical world around them and often communicate those reading over a network to a server or servers. Sensor networks can benefit from the generally “unlimited resources” of the cloud, namely processing, storage, and network resources. This literature review surveys the major components of distributed data management, namely, cloud computing, distributed persistence models, and distributed analytics.

Design, Implementation, and Initial Evaluation of OPQBox: A
low-cost device for crowdsourced power quality monitoring.
Technical Report CSDL-14-11, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI,
November 2014.
[ <a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/2014/14-11/14-11.pdf">.pdf</a> ]</p>
<blockquote><font size="-1">
The face of power distribution has changed rapidly over the last several decades. Modern grids are evolving to accommodate distributed power generation, and highly variable loads. Furthermore as the devices we use every day become more electronically complex, they become increasingly more sensitive to power quality problems. Distributed power quality monitoring systems have been shown to provide real-time insight on the status of the power grid and even pinpoint the origin of power disturbances. [6] Oahu’s isolated power grid combined with high penetration of distributed renewable energy generators create perfect conditions to assess the feasibility and utility of such a network. Over the last three months we have been collecting power quality data from several locations on Oahu as a pilot study for a larger monitoring system. This papers describes our methodology, hardware and software design and presents a preliminary analysis of the data we collected so far. Lastly this paper presents a design for an improved power quality monitor based upon the pilot study experiences.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Presents examples of using "Porto-Sag" to assess the impact of voltage sags on equipment.  Voltage sags are "the most important pq variation affecting sensitive equipment".  Voltage sags are defined in terms of magnitude (i.e. 50% of nominal) and duration (i.e. 4 cycles). Results on various computers (Dell, HP netserver, Compaq) show actual values for voltage sags that induce equipment failure.  Also looked at PLCs, relays, adjustable speed drives.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Harmonic currents generated by non-linear electronic loads increase power system heat losses and power bills for end users. These harmonic-related losses reduce system efficiency, cause apparatus overheating, and increase power and air conditioning costs. As the number of harmonics-producing loads has increased over the years, it has become increasingly necessary to address their influence when making any additions or changes to an installation.  Harmonic currents can have a significant impact on electrical distribution systems and the facilities they feed. It is important to consider their impact when planning additions or changes to a system. In addition, identifying the size and location of non-linear loads should be an important part of any maintenance, troubleshooting and repair program.

This article starts a seven-part series on the effects of power quality disturbances on a five-stage electronic LED driver. As electrical designers, we know each circuit has a characteristic frequency response, meaning that signals of some frequency can get through a circuit, and others cannot. The same is true when you talk about the effects of power quality (PQ) disturbances on electronic ballasts. Each disturbance category has its own frequency characteristics as well.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
There  has  been  a  concern  in  recent  years  for  electric  power  utilities  to  satisfy  the  increasingly expectations of not only the industrial and commercial, but also the residential users with  respect  to  the  quality  of  the  supplied  energy.  This  concern  calls  for  the  redesigning  of  the  existing  power  quality  indices  to  capture  all  the  industrial,  commercial  and  household  loads,  which  hitherto  has  not  been  considered.  Several  electric  power  indices  have  evolved  over  the  years  as  tools  to  represent,  quantify  and  measure  a  complex  issue  at  hand.  The  use  of  these  indices is widespread in the field of electric power generation, transmission and distribution.  Another way of quantifying power quality issues is the use of power acceptability curves. These curves are plots of bus voltage deviation versus time duration. And they separate the bus voltage  deviation  -  time  duration  plane  into  two  regions:  an  "acceptable"  and  "unacceptable".  Various power acceptability curves exist but the most widely publicized one, which could stand the  test  of  time  and  could  be  relied  on,  is  the  Computer  Business  Equipment  Manufacturers  Association  or  CBEMA  curve.  The  CBEMA  curve  has  been  in  existence  since  1970’s.  Its  primarily  intent  was  to  give  a  measure  of  the  vulnerability  of  mainframe  computer  to  the  disturbance  in  the  electric  power  supply.  But  the  curve  has  been  used  as  a  measure  of  power  quality indices for electric drives and solid-state loads.  In   this   report,   the   concept   of   'standards'   is   introduced   for   the   design   of   power   acceptability  curves.  The  power  acceptability  curves  are  aides  in  the  determination  of  whether  the  supply  voltage  to  a  load  is  acceptable  for  the  maintenance  of  a  load  process.    The  construction  of  the  well  known  CBEMA  power  acceptability  curve  is  discussed,  and  issues  of  three phase and rotating loads are discussed. iiiThe  main  conclusion  of  this  work  is  that  power  acceptability  curves  can  be  designed  to  detect compliance or noncompliance of the distribution supply to effect a standard. If the load is a  rectifier  load,  the  standard  is  generally  the  permissible  low  threshold  of  DC  voltage  at  the  rectifier  output.  Other  standards  are  possible  including  a  speed  standard  for  rotating  loads.  The  general  process  of  the  design  of  a  power  acceptability  curve  entails  the  solution  of  a  dynamic  model for the load. The dynamic solution then gives a standard parameter versus time, and this is compared with the ultimate standard (e.g., Vdc = 0.87 per unit). This gives a permissible duration of a voltage sag event. The method is easily extended to the unbalanced three phase case.  It  is  shown  in  the  report  that  the  CBEMA  curve  is  effectively  based  on  a  single  phase  rectifier  load  with  DC  threshold  voltage  of  0.87  per  unit  in  the  undervoltage  region.  A  double  exponential  equation  describing  the  curve  is  developed.  This  provides  a  useful  method  to  consider  the  effect  of  unbalanced  voltage  sags  and  to  develop  CBEMA-like  curves  for  other  types of loads. A scalar index of compliance with a power acceptability curve has been illustrated in this report as well.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
Electric power as a commodity is very different from other products – it is generated far from the point of use, is fed to the grid together with the output of many other generators and arrives at the point of use via several transformers and many kilometers of overhead and possibly underground cabling. Quality check of power is very important. But it has constantly been polluted by both consumers (non-linear loads) and utility companies (due to increased use of semi conductor based power processors). Assuring the quality of delivered power to be good enough for the application at hand calls for measurement and study of power quality at the point of common coupling.<p>
There are various categories of Power Quality issues. Issues related to voltage amplitude variations will include voltage sags/dips and voltage swells. Issue related to frequency is harmonics in the power system. Short term problems include transients and momentary interruptions. We have carried out a brief study of all these PQ issues, and problems caused by them.<p>
Developments in the field of power electronics has brought tremendous power processing capability to engineers but it has also polluted the power system with harmonics. Then there are non linear loads that inject harmonics in the power system. Measurement and estimation of harmonics in power system has become one of the most important tasks in the hands of power system engineers for increasing reliability and quality of supplied power. For harmonic analysis FFT based schemes are unable to give enough information for PQ mitigation. So researchers have been attempting other methods to estimate harmonics in sampled voltage and current signals. Among these; least square estimation, for estimating amplitudes and particle swarm optimization with passive congregation, for estimating phase and frequency used together has most attractive features of compactness and fastness. We have developed a harmonic estimator based on LSE and PSOPC to estimate amplitude, phase and frequency of the sampled signal. We have used the estimator on real time data acquired using a digital storage oscilloscope in Electrical Machines Laboratory of Department of Electrical Engineering at NIT Rourkela. The results for estimating integral harmonics are attractive and encourage researchers to modify the estimator code to make it able to estimate inter-harmonics and sub-harmonics also.

This paper describes countrywide electrical power quality (PQ) assessments of the Turkish Electricity Transmission System through a genuine PQ database. The database stores the output of mobile PQ measurement systems which are established at 172 transformer substations of the transmission system. At 601 measurement points in these substations, which are potentially critical in terms of PQ, measurements are carried out by the mobile systems for a period of 1 week. PQ parameters defined in the IEC-61000- 4-30 standard in addition to power values are calculated from acquired raw data by the mobile-monitoring system and the resulting data are transferred to the PQ database. The database, based on a novel PQ data model, enables its users to take PQ snapshots of the transmission system countrywide and can be accessed through several interfaces including a visual query interface, a natural language interface, and a map interface. The overall PQ status of the measured points, representing the characteristics of the transmission system, is assessed through these interfaces and problematic points are determined while deriving important conclusions about the transmission system’s PQ behavior. Moreover, several novel PQ assessment methods are proposed and their applications on the PQ data are demonstrated especially through the map interface.

To keep the routine assessment of PQ levels efficient, new and automated tools for validating, analysing and visualizing these data are required. The paper illustrates the challenges of processing long-term PQ monitoring campaigns by using measurement data at 8 different sites in public low voltage (LV) networks for more than one year (64 weeks). The paper is divided into two parts. The first part describes the measurement campaign, the pre-processing of the data and an easy and flexible way for routine compliance assessment. The second part is dedicated to the comparison of two different global PQ indices for assessing an average site performance as basis for e.g. benchmarking purposes.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
This paper presents the two main types of classification methods for power quality disturbances based on underlying causes: deterministic classification, giving an expert system as an example, and statistical classification, with support vector machines (a novel method) as an example. An expert system is suitable when one has limited amount of data and sufficient power system expert knowledge; however, its application requires a set of threshold values. Statistical methods are suitable when large amount of data is available for training. Two important issues to guarantee the effectiveness of a classifier, data segmentation, and feature extraction are discussed. Segmentation of a sequence of data recording is preprocessing to partition the data into segments each representing a duration containing either an event or a transition between two events. Extraction of features is applied to each segment individually. Some useful features and their effectiveness are then discussed. Some experimental results are included for demonstrating the effectiveness of both systems. Finally, conclusions are given together with the discussion of some future research directions.

This paper presents an effective method based on support vector machines (SVM) for identification of power system disturbances. Because of its advantages in signal processing applications, the wavelet transform (WT) is used to extract the distinctive features of the voltage signals. After the wavelet decomposition, the characteristic features of each disturbance waveforms are obtained. The wavelet energy criterion is also applied to wavelet detail coefficients to reduce the sizes of data set. After feature extraction stage SVM is used to classify the power system disturbance waveforms and the performance of SVM is compared with the artificial neural networks (ANN).

Wavelet and PCA to Power Quality Disturbance Classification
Applying a RBF Network.
In <em>Power Quality: Monitoring, Analysis, and
Enhancement</em>. InTechOpen, October 2010.
[ <a href="https://www.intechopen.com/books/power-quality-monitoring-analysis-and-enhancement/wavelet-and-pca-to-power-quality-disturbance-classification-applying-a-rbf-network">http</a> ]</p>
<blockquote><font size="-1">
This chapter proposes the application of a different method of power quality disturbance classification by combining discrete wavelet transform (DWT), principal component analysis (PCA) and an artificial neural network in order to classify power quality disturbances. The method proposes to analyze seven classes of signals, namely Sinusoidal Waveform, Capacitor Switching Transient, Flicker, Harmonics, Interruption, Notching and Sag, which is composed by four main stages: (1) signal analysis using the DWT; (2) feature extraction; (3) data reduction using PCA; (4) classification using a radial basis function network (RBF). The MRA technique of DWT is employed to extract the discriminating features of distorted signals at different resolution levels. Subsequently, the PCA is used to condense information of a correlated set of variables into a few variables, and a RBF network is employed to classify the disturbance types.

Electrical power is an important raw material for all commercial operations and, like any other raw material, the quality of supply is very important. The nature and causes of power quality defects have been outlined in Section 1 and are discussed in detail in later sections; this section concentrates on the effects of defects on production and the costs that can be expected to occur. As discussed in Section 1 there are five basic types of defect, each with different causes and effects and, of course, different cost implications.

The quality of the electrical supply has a direct impact on the correct function and operation of equipment connected to the public electricity supply network. There is an expectation that devices will operate as designed and that equipment lifetime should, statistically, be close to the designed value. The reliability of the network is generally assumed to be high enough so as to not cause unacceptable issues with regard to loss of production or loss of functionality. Quantifying the cost to the consumer when the supply power quality or reliability are not as expected is an important metric and can be used as business case to justify expenditure in order to improve the supply network. This paper explores the research associated with quantifying the cost of reliability and power quality. Several power quality disturbances are investigated and possible methods of quantifying both the effect and cost are presented. Due to the complex nature of equipment performance with regard to power quality, there is a need for extensive research in order to develop a generalised approach to lifetime and cost evaluation.

Poor power quality has come to stay in most parts of the world. In most part of Africa, especially in Nigeria, it is almost normal not to have good clean power free from disturbances. If power equipment and loads could talk or express feelings, I am sure they would have made a big protest against the great injustice imposed on them. A survey was carried out amongst 15 multi-national companies in southwest Nigeria to ascertain the cause(s) and effects of poor power quality on electrical equipment and its economic implications. The survey revealed that 9 out of 15 of those companies loose an average of 5 variable speed (AC) drives every year owing to poor power quality. It also revealed that the most common disturbances faced are voltage sag and swell. This paper is aimed at stating some of the predominant power disturbance parameters, their sources and causes, the effect they have on electrical equipment, and their cost/economic implications. It also identifies some practical solutions and methods of addressing poor power quality issues

Power quality issues and need of intelligent PQ monitoring in the

<blockquote><font size="-1">
PQ issues are very much important for utilities, customers and end users and it is essential to be known by the concerned authorities and users for reduction of economic losses due to the poor PQ. The cost of poor PQ is high and rising. The paper gives insights on global economical losses due to poor PQ. The business risk posed by PQ problems is a real one with even ‘low tech’ industries exposed to serious financial losses. The global economic meltdown is not the only factor that is pulling down the revenues of Asian countries. A study released said Indian industries lost more than $ 9.6 billion in 2008-09 due to power outages. According to 2008 reports, poor power quality costs European business more than 150 billion dollars a year.<p>
In this paper, a comprehensive survey on different power quality related problems as experienced by customers in different countries are highlighted. Summary of PQ costs are given. As the consequence of poor PQ might have large financial impacts on a country’s economy, more initiatives are expected from the concerned parties and regulating bodies to take corrective measures for maintaining better power quality from utility and at end users. Smart grid requires intelligent PQ monitoring to solve different PQ related problems. Authors proposed an intelligent power quality monitoring system that will help to detect different PQ disturbances and consequently assist in employing or implementing appropriate mitigation techniques.

IEEE 1159 is a recommended practice for monitoring electric power quality. Among the clauses within this standard is a section describing the measurement instruments for power quality monitoring. Depending on the situation being addressed, or the survey being made, a variety of different measuring instruments could be used. For simple situations, a handheld multimeter or oscilloscope could suffice. For more involved situations, a dedicate power quality monitor might be required. No matter how sophisticated, each measuring instrument has limitations that should be considered. Often these limitations are imposed by the response of the voltage and/or current probes and transducers, external to the measurement device. This paper outlines these various issues that should be considered when selecting a measuring instrument for use to measure power quality and its influence in an electrical power system.

Nowadays, large scale monitoring of Power Quality (PQ) in electrical power plants is a pressing need in many countries due to the liberalization of the electrical market and the deeper interconnections of electrical networks. Many instruments are available on the market but their cost make them not suited for the purpose. To overcome this problem the paper proposes a prototypal measurement instrument for PQ monitoring based on field programmable gate arrays, in compliance with IEC 61000-4-30 and IEC 61000-4-7 standards. Features of the proposing instrument are the good accuracy and the cost effectiveness. The realized instrument applies a novel digital filter approach to harmonic and interharmonic estimation. After a detailed description of the proposed instrument, an experimental performance characterization in emulated environment is presented. Results are also compared with those furnished by a FFT approach suggested by IEC61000-4-7 standard confirming the goodness of the proposal.

Monitoring systems related to power quality were built in order to verify that a system or machine is functioning properly in accordance to standards. This paper aims to present a system that was developed on the CompactRIO controller from National Instruments. As a programming tool, LabVIEW software was used to elaborate the platform in order to monitor and to detect disturbances that can occur in any power system.  Methods such as Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and the Wavelet transform were used to monitor harmonics on the system and to detect short time voltage variations. When a short duration voltage fluctuation or an exceeding in the harmonic limits is noticed, the implemented system records the event time for further analysis. The platform also records all the signal in the time domain continuously without any blank window. The postprocessing is performed using the samples of the recorded signal. The analyzer can choose the amount of pre- and/or post event time, in 60 Hz cycles, to rebuild the event waveform. To validate the platform, it was subjected to tests such as the system voltage variation, momentary interruption, voltage sag and violations in harmonic distortion rates.

One of the most important characteristics of the electric power system is its observability. The observability is essential not only for the power flows and power supply reliability indices, but also for the power quality indicators, particularly for the nonsinusoidality of supply voltage waveform. The wide use of power electronics components in intelligent electric power systems, which will increase in the future, leads to the occurrence of harmonic voltage and currents. Moreover, the electric power system facilities can be represented by both the sources and the consumers of high harmonics []. In this connection the assessment of impact of individual facilities on the power quality is a topical problem. The observability of electric power systems can be provided with the use of phasor measurement units (PMUs). The paper proposes a distributed power quality monitoring system based on the available PMU infrastructure to continuously control the level of high harmonics in different cutsets of the electric power system.

With the development of Chinese smart grid, power quality problem becomes more and more serious, and it is most urgent to establish a large-scale management system which can real-time monitor multi-node power quality of power generation, transmission and distribution aspects. Power quality monitoring IED based on the design of IEC61850 standard for substation automation system can unify device external port, effectively solve interoperability problem of different devices, and greatly simplify the architecture design and communication network of large-scale power quality management system. This article develops a high-performance distributed power quality monitoring IED based on I EC6 1850 standard. The IED is composed by three cores high-performance PowerPC, D S P and FPGA. So it can realize high-speed acquisition, real-time processing and analysis of huge amounts of data. It supports both high-speed analog sampling and digital sampling that means the IED can receive IEC61850-9-2 packets through SV module. The SV and CPU modules exchange real-time data via high-speed LVDS bus on the backplane. The monitoring IED can be installed on any monitoring node as its distributed architecture design. Through MMS service the remote monitoring center collects power quality data of all monitoring nodes, according to the data analysis, completes the funtions of power quality disturbance identification, power quality disturbance source localization, power quality assessment, etc.

A good power quality (PQ) is an important factor for the reliable operation of electrical loads. High penetration of nonlinear loads, such as compact fluorescent lamps, light-emitting diode (LED) lamps, switching mode power suppliers give rise to serious challenges in power quality for distribution systems. Harmonic distortion produced by nonlinear loads causes several problems, ranging from increased power losses in customer equipment, power transformers and power lines, shorter life of organic insulation to malfunction of electronic devices and telecommunication systems.  Last decade power quality issues have become serious concern for commercial and office customers. According to Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) estimates, more than 70% of all loads are nonlinear.  The IEEE and international standards [1, 2] set the limits for harmonic distortions. However they do not offer any strategy for the detection of distorting sources in the grid.  Information on the location of the distorted sources can be obtained by distributed measurement system abled to perform simultaneous measurements in different nodes of the considered grid.  This paper describes a distributed measurement system for power quality monitoring. The results of PQ measurements are reported.

This work describes some of the constrictions and requirements assumed for the design of the high performance Power Quality data logger PQ1000, taking into account the international standards IEC 61000-4-30 Class A and the IEC 61000-4-15 published in August 2010. Trough it, the most important demands of the IEC 61000-4-30 class A instruments are exposed. Details of the hardware components are also shown, and the most important points of the signal processing path are explained. The performance in the RMS values determination is given, also the frequency response for harmonics measurement are shown, and a detailed analysis of fulfillment of the tests given in the IEC 61000-4-15 ed. 08-2010 are given in the final section. Before the publication of this ed.08-2010 the Cigre C4.1.01/CIRED 2 CC02/UIE WG2 - 2004 protocol was the reference document that in addition with the IEC standard was used for the evaluation of digital flicker meters. This protocol aim is to guarantee a higher degree of compatibility between instruments of different manufacturers and models. The tests here presented intend to submit the equipments to a more real situation, and try to show possible hardware or firmware defects. The results given by the PQ1000 widely surpasses the standards exigencies.

Power quality metrics calculations for the smart grid.
May 2013.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
The main goal of this project was to create a software system that analyzed data collected from smart meters and alerted the user of power quality issues. Power quality, for the purposes of this project, will be defined as IEEE Std 1159 states, “a wide variety of electromagnetic phenomena that characterize the voltage and current at a given time and at a given location on the power system.” Power quality metrics are defined by a percentage variance from the nominal value over a period of time. The metrics focused on in this report were limited by the resolution of data collected from the smart meters, which was 16.67 ms. This resolution allowed us to analyze disturbances including voltage sags, voltage swells, and harmonics (these disturbances will be further discussed in the body of the report). Along with these disturbances, we also found intervals in the data where low power factor (PF) was of concern.<p>
During phase one; we researched definitions, causes, and effects of the aforementioned disturbances. From this, we determined that the best approach to classify these issues would be to use the per-unit system and classify them according to parameters set for power quality issues described in IEEE Std 1159. Once enough data was collected, algorithms were written to extract the data from a comma separated value (.csv) file and uploaded into MatLab. Once the data was uploaded into MatLab, techniques such as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and averaging sliding window were carried out to locate disturbances. The FFT gave us a means to traverse between the time domain and the frequency domain. The averaging sliding window acted as a low pass filter and got rid of noise that would otherwise flag the beginning of a disturbance haphazardly, ultimately slowing down our algorithms. The algorithms were written as functions, tested and compared with known results from other sources, and then added to a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI was designed to logically allow any user to plot and textually output any power quality issues, found within our resolution limits, for their own inspection.

Electrical power quality (PQ) data is one of the prevalent types of engineering data. Its measurement at
relevant sampling rates leads to large volumes of PQ data to be managed and analyzed. In this paper, an
extensible database architecture is presented based on a novel generic data model for PQ data. The proposed
architecture is operated on the nationwide PQ data of the Turkish Electricity Transmission System
measured in the field by mobile PQ monitoring systems. The architecture is extensible in the sense that it
can be used to store and manage PQ data collected by any means with little or no customization. The
architecture has three modules: a PQ database corresponding to the implementation of the generic data
model, a visual user query interface to enable its users to specify queries to the PQ database and a query
processor acting as a bridge between the query interface and the database. The operation of the architecture
is illustrated on the field PQ data with several query examples through the visual query interface.
The execution of the architecture on this data of considerable volume supports its applicability and convenience
for PQ data.

Real-time situational awareness tools are of critical importance to power system operators, especially during emergencies. The availability of electric power has become a linchpin of most post-disaster response efforts, because public and private sector services depend upon it. Knowledge of the scope and extent of facilities impacted, as well as the duration of their dependence on backup power, enables emergency response officials to plan for contingencies and provide a better overall response. Based on the measurement data acquired by the frequency disturbance recorders deployed in the North American power grids, an off-grid detection method is proposed and implemented. This method monitors the critical electrical loads and detects the transition of these loads from an on-grid operation to an off-grid operation, during which the loads are fed by an uninterrupted power supply or a backup generation system. The details of the detection algorithm are presented, and some case studies and off-grid detection scenarios are also provided to verify the effectiveness and robustness. This paper also presents the real-time implementation of this method and several effectively detected off-grid situations. Moreover, two visualization tools are developed to display the real-time system operation condition in an intuitive manor.

Recently, growing electrical energy market and increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RES) in power systems have lead to new challenges on network planning step and operation, thus it is required to investigate and analyze properly the impacts of integrated RES on the power system. In this paper, the electricity transmission network with wind farms (WF) is modeled. For the grid model, a part of Izmir region is chosen due to the amount of installed generation plants based RES especially wind energy in this region. The comparison between unexpected variations to voltage profile of the power system before and after RES integration to the power system is demonstrated. In the modeling of the electricity transmission network with RES, Digsilent/Power Factory is used as software. The different case studies in integration of different amounts of RES are implemented on the developed grid model. As a result of the conducted case studies, effects of RES on existing power system are evaluated and graphics obtained from the simulation are presented.

The impact of renewable energy installations connected to the utility grid is an important issue concerning the technical and economic viability of harnessing these emerging energy sources. Distribution networks must be carefully controlled in order to maintain an acceptable power supply quality. The major sources of non-conventional energy are small scale generation and storage from mini hydro, photovoltaic, wind power, fuel cells, battery, flywheel, pump storage and biomass. The aim of this thesis is to analyse the variation in voltage of the distribution network when renewable energy sources are interconnected to the distribution network, in terms of it's stability. In particular this study analyses the impact of interconnection of small synchronous generators to the utility power grid. Dynamic stability analysis is mainly concerned with analysing the response of electrical power system to small perturbation about a given operating point. These studies are particularly important due to the growing interest in interconnecting small renewable energy sources to large and complex power systems. Simulation studies were carried out in order to find out the transient stability and voltage stability of the non-conventional energy sources under different operating conditions. A 5-second simulation was conducted using explicit numerical integration (Euler method) and an integration time step of 0.002 second. Power System Toolbox was used for analysis.The multimachine power system models used in this thesis are generated in MATLAB code. The load flow is performed on the multimachine power system correponding to the loading condition to be investigated. The machines are represented by the two-axis models, the exciters by IEEE Type-1 models and the loads are modelled as constant impedances. To save programming time, it has become common to limit the machine and exciter representations to some specified models. The network admittance matrix is reduced by retaining only the internal buses of the generators. The reduced network, machine and exciter data are then combined to form a linearised state-space model representing the entire system. The simulation studies are applied to a four machine ten bus system. It is clear from the analysis that much care should be taken based on the stability point of view while interconnecting the small renewable energy sources to the utility. The renewable energy sources should be interconnected at a point which provides higher stability margin.The renewable energy sources is a viable option if it is connected to the distribution network with necessary methods of improving transient stability and voltage stability.

abstract: There has been a considerable growth in distributed photovoltaic (PV) genera-tion and its integration in electric power distribution systems. This has led to a change in the distribution system infrastructure. Properly planned distributed gen-eration can offer a variety of benefits for system operations and enhance opera-tional performance of the distribution system. However, high penetration of PV resources can give rise to operating conditions which do not arise in traditional systems and one of the potential issues that needs to be addressed involves impact on power quality of the system with respect to the spectral distortion in voltages and currents. The test bed feeder model representing a real operational distribution feeder is developed in OpenDSS and the feeder modeling takes into consideration the ob-jective of analysis and frequency of interest. Extensive metering infrastructure and measurements are utilized for validation of the model at harmonic frequencies. The harmonic study performed is divided into two sections: study of impact of non-linear loads on total harmonic voltage and current distortions and study of impact of PV resources on high frequency spectral distortion in voltages and cur-rents. The research work incorporates different harmonic study methodologies such as harmonic and high frequency power flow, and frequency scan study. The general conclusions are presented based on the simulation results and in addition, scope for future work is discussed. Dissertation/Thesis Masters Thesis Electrical Engineering 2014

The generation of electricity through renewable sources has exponentially increased in recent years in response to environmental pollution caused by fossil fuels. When we talk about renewable energy is difficult not to refer to solar photovoltaic technology due to its high rate of growth compared to their peers and potential. This is associated with the fact that the Ecuadorian government is implementing a process of changing the production and country's energy matrix where one of the fundamental pillars is to eliminate dependence on fossil resources and promote the use of renewable energy. Therefore, this makes clear that it is important and needed to study the effects and possible problems that entails the use of photovoltaic systems connected to the network. In this context, this work focuses on power quality by connecting photovoltaic plants to low-power electrical distribution networks. The evaluated system is composed of a group of panels of different technologies connected to a communication unit that forms the connection point of the photovoltaic system and the electric network. Measurement and data acquisition in real time of the implemented system and the respective analysis was made by considering the existing regulations. Finally, a mathematical analysis was performed in order to analyze the impact of the most important variables on power quality.

The abundance, availability, and climate-friendly characteristics of solar photovoltaic (PV) energy encourage nations around the globe to adopt it to assist in overcoming global warming as well as build a sustainable society for the future. The intermittent nature of solar energy generation and the associated power electronic inverters with connected consumer loads creates a number of potential challenges in integrating large-scale PV into the grid that affects power quality of the distribution networks. This paper investigates the impacts of varying PV integration into the grid through experimental and simulation studies. Initially, several experiments were conducted with varying PV penetration and load conditions using the Renewable Energy Integration Facility at CSIRO, Newcastle, Australia. Later, a simulation model was developed that mimics the experimental facility used at CSIRO to investigate the adverse impacts on integrating large-scale PV into the grid using the power system simulation software PSS Sincal. Experimental and simulation analyses clearly indicate that integration of PV into the grid causes power quality issues such as voltage instability, harmonic injection, and low power factor into the networks and the level of these impacts increases with the increase of PV penetration.

The stochastic nature of PVDG and loads were considered in the study using probabilistic techniques. The impact of PVDG on the number of tap changes of the voltage regulators was investigated. The tests results in a real life large scale distribution network demonstrated that the PVDG can cause around 31% of improvements in the voltage conformity indices. This impact is less beneficial than the one associated with the connection of conventional distributed generation due to the variability in the primary energy resource. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the connection of PVDG increases the lifespan of the voltage regulators as a result of a reduction about 20% in the number of tap changes.

Electricity generation from solar energy by using PV cells is drastically increased due to global warming concern, greenhouse effect, and quality of living standards. However, PV generation may offer variable and unpredictable energy output due to intermittent nature of solar irradiance and hence, integration of PV into grid may provide some drawback effect to the power system. The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of grid connected PV system on the power quality of distribution network. The power quality analysis is based on real measurements of 10 kWp, Energy Park SERT, School of Renewable Energy, Naresuan University, Thailand. Parameters such as active and reactive power, voltage, current, power factor, THDv, THDi, individual harmonic voltage and harmonic current are observed for the investigation of the interaction between SERT PV system and distribution network’s power quality. According to the measured data, PV system operation is negligible in terms of voltage distortion, voltage magnitude and frequency variation. Therefore, it can be noticed that 10 kWp SERT PV system does not effect on the distribution system power quality due to low PV penetration level.

Photovoltaic (PV) generation systems have been increasingly used to generate electricity from renewable sources, attracting a growing interest. Recently, grid connected PV micro-generation facilities in individual homes have increased due to governmental policies as well as greater attention by industry. As low voltage (LV) distribution systems were built to make energy flow in one direction, the power feed-in of PV generation in rural low-voltage grids can influence power quality (PQ) as well as facility operation and reliability. This paper presents results on PQ analysis of a real PV generation facility connected to a rural low-voltage grid. Voltage fluctuations and voltage harmonic contents were observed. Statistical analysis shows a negative impact on PQ produced by this PV facility and also that only a small fraction of the energy available during a sunny day is converted, provoking losses of revenue and forcing the converter to work in an undesirable operating mode. We discuss the disturbances imposed upon the grid and their outcome regarding technical and economic viability of the PV system, as well as possible solutions. A low-voltage grid strengthening has been suggested and implemented. After that a new PQ analysis shows an improvement in the impact upon PQ, making this facility economically viable.

The rapid increase of the grid-connected solar photovoltaic (PV) has been reported to make a considerable impact on the power quality (PQ) in the grid. This paper discusses the generation and propagation of significant current/voltage harmonics which are caused by PV inverters in distribution networks. The impact made by high switching frequencies and different operating scenarios are studied by detailed modelling of PV inverters in a typical low voltage (LV) distribution network using PSCAD/EMTDC simulation platform. It was found that the PV inverter systems inject high frequency current harmonics at the switching frequency or associated side bands. Low order current harmonics are also significant due to the inability of switching control system of PV inverter to produce perfectly sinusoidal output. It is found that the amount of harmonics depend on the inverter control strategy, background distortion present at the point of connection (POC) and the percentage of inverter loading. Further, harmonic voltage distortion is found to be mainly dependent on the impedance of the distribution network where weak networks lead to give rise to higher voltage distortions. Moreover, harmonic resonances are significant due to the interaction of the inverter output impedance and the grid inductance. The current harmonics injected by single phase inverters have been found substantial and influential with regard to the energy transmission and increase losses.

The rapid growth of variable electricity generation in low-voltage electricity grids poses new challenges to the operation of power systems. Distributed non-dispatchable electricity from renewable sources, such as photovoltaic solar energy, can potentially impact power quality, particularly voltage regulation. In response, inverter manufacturers and recent standards have introduced automatic inverter response functions, such as the commonly known as Volt-Watt and Volt-VAR functions. These functions aim to mitigate under- and over-voltage events by gracefully curtailing injected active power, or injecting/absorbing reactive power when the voltage at the point of coupling exceeds the predefined regulation limits. While the utility of these new inverter functionalities has been established in various studies, the analysis of their stability properties, particularly in the context of persistent changes in load, remains scarce. This paper contributes a framework for nonlinear analysis of voltage stability and boundedness in distribution networks with variable loads. The framework is applied to the case of a single grid-connected inverter to derive sufficient conditions for steady-state voltage boundedness as a function of the load variation levels in the inverter bus. Simulation results illustrate the accuracy of these bounds for varying load conditions.

In recent decades, the presence of photovoltaic (PV) systems is increased to provide power for local or remote loads. However, when a large PV system connects to the distribution network under variable weather conditions, it may cause severe problems for power system components. This paper presents a dynamic power quality analysis on a grid-connected PV system in a distribution system subjected to different weather conditions. A 1.8 MW grid-connected PV system in a radial 16 bus test system is modelled and simulated under varying solar irradiations using the Matlab/Simulink software. The simulation results proved that the presence of high penetrated grid-connected PV systems can cause power quality problems such as voltage rise, voltage flicker and power factor reduction.
